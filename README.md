# AudioVisualizer
This Audio Visualizer is made with [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/) and [Love2Dcs](https://github.com/endlesstravel/Love2dCS) which is a C# port of [Löve2D](http://love2d.org/).  
It's a .NET Core project but it won't work on other platforms than Windows due to the limitations of NAudio.  
The aim of this project is to reproduce an audio visualizer similar to the Monstercat's one.
